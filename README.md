# clj-sql-up
A Leiningen plugin to manage SQL database migrations simply and dynamically with clojure/jdbc.

## Features
* Database agnostic (migrations are created from sequences of sql strings)
* Supports creation of stored procedures / other complicated sql statements
* Runs within clojure so sql strings can easily be dynamically constructed
* Has a simple `create` command for generating migration files

## Install
In your project.clj file:

Put `[clj-sql-up "0.1.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector 
Add database connection info (both your driver and jdbc connection string):

    :clj-sql-up {:database "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/foo?foo"
                 :deps [[org.postgresql/postgresql "9.2-1003-jdbc4"]]}

## Usage
Basic usage (though it doesn't get much more complicated):

    $ lein clj-sql-up create create-posts

```clojure
;; migrations/20130712101745082-create-posts.clj

(defn up []
  ["CREATE TABLE foo(id int)"
   "CREATE INDEX foo_index ON foo(id)"])

(defn down []
  ["drop table foo"])
```
### TODO
	$ lein clj-sql-up migrate
    $ lein clj-sql-up rollback 2

## Motivation
This library was inspired by weavejester's [ragtime](https://github.com/weavejester/ragtime/) library (and uses a few code snippets from that project).  The motivation for starting a new project was to make things a bit more in line structurally with other well-known migration tools and easily allow for creation of more complicated sql commands (eg: stored procedures/functions).  Also was a great opportunity to learn about leiningen plugins :)
